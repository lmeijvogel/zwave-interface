Some steps for installing:
* First, make and install the openzwave library:
    http://code.google.com/p/open-zwave/source/checkout

  Also do a make install to create the shared library.
  (in my case, it was installed in /usr/local/lib64)

  libudev-dev
  Compilation went OK, but when running the application,
  I got an error about not finding the shared library.
  To fix that, add a file containing the path to the
  installation directory, in my case:

    /usr/local/lib64

  to /etc/ld.so.conf.d and run

    sudo ldconfig

  In my case, I checked out the zwave source in
  ../open-zwave-read-only. If you put it somewhere else,
  you should change it in the Makefile.

* Install the hiredis library:
    sudo apt-get install libhiredis-dev

* Don't forget to include boost:
  - Download 1_55_0 (the .tar.gz version, I could not get
    the GitHub version to work), place it in the project
    dir and build it (./b2 etc.).
    If you don't name the boost directory 'boost_1_55_0',
    you'll probably have to change the Makefile.

Using the program

Small hint: At least in raspbian, the user running the program
should be a member of the dialout group
